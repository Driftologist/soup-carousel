soup-carousel
=============

As simple as making soup with a blender. No tag-soup. Super smooth animation.

The carousel can handle as many frames as you like, though for UX reasons I wouldn't recomend more than 5-6 as users wont wait around to see beyond that in almost all cases. Each article tag inside the carousel section tag is a frame in the carousel which will automatically be picked up and added to the queue.

For ease everything is wrapped in the excelent html 5 boiler plate: http://html5boilerplate.com/

The timer can be set on line 39 of main.js, it is listed in seconds.

The colour of the loading bar can be set on line 46 of main.js using the standard rgba system from css.
